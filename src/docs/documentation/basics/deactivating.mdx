# How to deactivate your account?

So, you've made up your mind? Is this your final decision?
Okay, if you say so...

To deactivate your account, just go to the [settings page](https://bubblin.io/settings#profile) of your profile.

Now, go to the security tab, at the last you will find the option to deactivate your account.

But, we are sad to see you go :(
