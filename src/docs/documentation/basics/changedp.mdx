# How to change your profile picture?

Want to update your profile picture?

Just go to the [Settings Page](https://bubblin.io/settings#profile) of your profile.

<div class="two-third center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/assets/master/profile-menu.PNG" width="100%" />
</div>

There, you will find the option to change your Avatar.

By the way, looking super cool in that new photo!
