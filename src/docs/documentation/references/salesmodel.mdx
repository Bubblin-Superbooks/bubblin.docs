# Sales Model
Selling a `Price Point` alone does not guarantee that your book is behind the paywall. It just says that your book is premium content. The content itself is still open for anyone to read and share.

Some writers prefer to take this path by leaving their paid work(s) open with a trust and hope that community will be happy to pay. To lock the content itself use the `Page Marker` 

## Page Marker:

The second pricing tool i.e the `Page Marker` locks down the contents of a book at the |page_number|. This allows you to sample a chapter or two from the beginning of your book and have the visitors interested in your work with more confidence.

Value on `Page Marker` field must be an even number. All pages of your book after the `Page Marker` are available to readers only after a purchase has been made.
