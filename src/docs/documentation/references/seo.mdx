# Tips to improve the SEO of your Superbook

### 1. Optimize your images
Pictures and other images are great for your website.
But you need to make sure they are optimized properly if you want these images to improve your SEO ranking.
We are referring to factors such as the file format and size.
Huge images can slow your page loading time, which, as I’ve said, hurts your ranking.

### 2. Try to get as many trusted backlinks as possible
Backlinks are a major reason why some websites outrank other on the web. The same way, Superbooks can also be made SEO friendly using quality backlinks.
Remember and focus on the word "trusted". It is highly advised to stay away from all the black-hat ways to get backlinks as search engines are smart enough to figure it out pretty easily these days.

### 3. Fix any broken links
If you’re using hyperlinks anywhere in your book, you should keep an eye out for broken links.
Broken links can crush your SEO ranking. Plus, it doesn’t look good when a link you provide to your visitors brings them to an invalid website.

### 4. Encourage everyone to share your Superbook
Sharability increases the number of views, which hence increases your overall ranking on search engines and even on Bubblin.

### 5. Use your keywords wisely, yet as much as possible
Keywords are one of the more basic things that a search engine looks for on a webpage. Hence, you should also use your keywords wherever you can, but still try not to overuse them else your readers won't like what they see.
