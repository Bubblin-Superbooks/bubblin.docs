# Selling your book
Helping writers make money off their work is an important goal of Bubblin. We provide a simple set of [tools](/docs/pricingtools) to price and sell your book easily.

With a freedom unlike anywhere else.

There are 3 steps to follow:

1. Choose a price point for your book,
2. Determine a [sales model](/docs/salesmodel),
3. View the royalty structure (if applicable).

...and done. Your book is ready to go!

One of the big advantage here is that Bubblin lets you choose a price for your book flexibly. According to your readership. You can also choose to publish your work for free!
It is totally up to you-the creator-how you want to build your own community for readers.
