# Why Superbooks?

Web has been generally bad at longform. Handling a large corpus of text has not only been traditionally difficult (from the beginning of web/time?) but nigh impossible to relax with and enjoy as a reader. As compared to say a physical book, a digital file leaves a lot to ask for and frankly books are not files to begin with! It is no wonder that most people including the developers themselves prefer buying a physical copy even for subjects like CSS, or Rust or JavaScript where tech moves faster than print could ever be rolled out.

Apart from issues of inaccessibility of the inner pages of book (or of content deep down on a long infinite scroll), the scourge of propreitary file formats that are generally incompatible with each other along with a loose reflowable layout makes it hard — nearly impossible — for even the most ardent book fans to be on the same page.

With Superbooks people can finally enjoy longform online the way they do with a physical book. It brings tight scalable and responsive formatting using [strong layouts](/docs/layout/) and a high quality finish that sports even page-level referenceability. Unlike an enterprise-y file (like PDF or Epub) that people are forced to download a Superbooks is simply a website with the native experience of books. Superbook format is a live specification. All feedback and inputs are welcomed on forum to make it as robust and accessisble as possible.
