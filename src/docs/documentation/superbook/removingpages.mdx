# Removing pages

While adding a page automatically adds 2 pages at a time, removing deletes only 1 page from the book.

<div class="two-third center">

</div>

Bookiza on the other hand, removes the page at `page_no` and append a new blank page at the end of the manuscript to maintain the length of the book.
Try with:

```
$ bookiza remove [page_no]
```
