# Adding a new page

Adding a new page on Bubblin book editor is akin to adding atleast 2 pages at a time. It is done to enforce "evenality" of book length.

Click on the + button on the editor toolbar to add 2 fresh pages on the spot where `activePage` had been.

<div class="two-third center">

</div>

On the other hand, with Bookiza...

```
$ bookiza add --leafs [number]
```

...will append pages at the end of the book. To insert N pages in the middle of the book, use:

```
$ bookiza insert --leafs [N/2]
```
