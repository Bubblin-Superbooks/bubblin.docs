# Royalities

Another very important step about pricing is understanding royalities or the commission structure.

We make money through our revenue share on sales, which is 15% for all Superbooks.

## Are payment processing fees included in the revenue share rates?

No, processing fees are separate and typically range between 3-6% depending on your country of residence.
Please visit Stripe Connect (payment processor) to understand how it works, including tips on what you can do to maximize your sales.

## How do I get paid and how often?

Stripe manages this for you automatically.
