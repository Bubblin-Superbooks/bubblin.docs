# Pricing Tools

Bubblin offers a set of pricing tools that helps writers easily price their book according to their own choice.
Superbook, by default, is unpriced and unmarked i.e unlocked. When a book is published without a price and a marker, all of its pages are available for anyone to view & share for free.

To set a price, go to your book in editing mode and simply add `Price Point` in cents (US) at which you wish to sell your book, via the overlay (shown) on the Pricing tab.

The minimum value is 51Â¢.
